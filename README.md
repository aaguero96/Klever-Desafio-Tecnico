<h1>Klever technical challange</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The Technical Challenge consists of creating an API with Golang using gRPC with stream pipes that exposes an upvote service endpoints.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

- Technical requirements:
  - Keep the code in Github.

- API:
  - The API must guarantee the typing of user inputs. If an input is expected as a string, it can only be received as a string;
  - The structs used with your mongo model should support Marshal/Unmarshal with bson, json and struct;
  - The API should contain unit test of methods it uses.

- Extra:
  - Deliver the whole solution running in some free cloud service.

<h2>Deadline</h2>

- `üìÖ 29 jul 2022 - Friday`

<h2>Run application (local)</h2>

1. clone git reposiory
- `git clone git@github.com:aaguero96/Klever-Desafio-Tecnico.git` for SSH or `git clone https://github.com/aaguero96/Klever-Desafio-Tecnico.git` for HTTPS.

2. Enter inside repository
- `cd Klever-Desafio-Tecnico`

3. Docker run mongoDB
- `docker run -d --name=mongo -p 27017:27017 bitnami/mongodb`, this step could be skipped if you have mongoDB runing on port 27017.

4. Install requirements
- `go mod tidy`.

5. Run gRPC service
- `go run gRPC_server/main.go`
- In this item you have permissions to do requests to localhost:50052 with gRPC API.

6. Run API service
- `go run api/main.go`
- In this item you have permissions to do requests to localhost:5000 with protocol http as client of gRPC server.
- This item is an extra for applicatio, because test requirements need only gRPC API.

<h2>Manual tests with Postman (local)</h2>

<h3>For gRPC requests</h3>

1. Create API in postman
  - In field `APIs`, click on button `New` on top of page:
  <img src="https://github.com/aaguero96/Klever-Desafio-Tecnico/blob/main/images/gRPC_1.png?raw=true"/>
  - Click on `gRPC request`:
  <img src="https://github.com/aaguero96/Klever-Desafio-Tecnico/blob/main/images/gRPC_2.png?raw=true"/>
  - In `Select method` click on `Import a .proto file`:
  <img src="https://github.com/aaguero96/Klever-Desafio-Tecnico/blob/main/images/gRPC_3.png?raw=true"/>
  - Select an proto file, in this repository have three proto files at `proto/*.proto`, you have to do this, and next itens in item 1., procedures three times to test all requests.
  - Click on button `Next`:
  <img src="https://github.com/aaguero96/Klever-Desafio-Tecnico/blob/main/images/gRPC_4.png?raw=true"/>
  - Name API in fied `API name` and name Version in field `Version name`:
  <img src="https://github.com/aaguero96/Klever-Desafio-Tecnico/blob/main/images/gRPC_5.png?raw=true"/>
  - Click on `Import as API`.
  - In field `Enter server URL` insert `localhost:50052`.
  - Select field `message`:
  <img src="https://github.com/aaguero96/Klever-Desafio-Tecnico/blob/main/images/gRPC_6.png?raw=true"/>
